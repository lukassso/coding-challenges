Step 1: Problem Analysis
1. We are given a list of intervals[][], where each element [start, end] represents a numeric interval.
2. We need to merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of merged intervals.
3. The intervals are not sorted, but their values are integers.
4. We need to find a solution with the best possible time complexity.

Step 2: Algorithm Chosen â€“ Sorting + Greedy Approach
1. We sort the intervals based on their start values to make detecting overlapping intervals easier.
2. We create a variable merged[] to store the merged intervals.
3. We iterate through the sorted intervals and check:
4. If the current interval overlaps with the previous one (previous.end >= current.start), we merge them.
5. If the interval is not overlapping, we add it as a new independent interval.
6. The time complexity is O(n log n) (sorting) + O(n) (iteration) = O(n log n).

Step 3: Implementation
*/
// We define the function that takes `intervals` as a parameter, which is a two-dimensional array of numbers.
// The function returns a two-dimensional array of numbers representing the merged intervals.
function merge(intervals: number[][]): number[][] {
  // Sort intervals based on start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  // We define a variable which is a two-dimensional array, and initialize it as an empty array.
  const merged: number[][] = [];

  // We define a `for` loop to iterate through each index of `intervals`
  for (const interval of intervals) {
    // We use an `if` statement to check if `merged.length` is empty or if the last interval in `merged` does not overlap with interval
    if (!merged.length || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
      // If true, we add `interval` to `merged` using the push method.
      merged.push(interval);
    } else {
      // Otherwise, we merge the overlapping intervals by updating the `end` value of the last interval in `merged`
      merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(
        merged[merged.length - 1][1],
        interval[1]
      );
    }
  }

  // Return merged intervals
  return merged;
}
